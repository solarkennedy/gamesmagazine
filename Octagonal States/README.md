### A Message From The Winner

    Hi, I was the winner of this contest. I've never edited a wiki so have no clue what I'm doing.
    This contest was really really difficult! I did it all by hand, and "luckily" had been without my computer for a couple months so devoted many hours to it.
    Was stuck on 23 states for quite a while and rather randomly fit in 24 states at the end, then got lucky against the other two with 24 states.
    This is the first/only Games contest I've ever won after subscribing for 20 or so years and entering maybe 1/10 contests.
    My sister was also a Games enthusiast, we started in a very old Scavenger Hunt. So I was thrilled at bringing in the "holy grail" to our family of the Games Contest.
    Thanks for the site, but at least there's one contest that defies computers! :P 

Thanks Dave! You are right, this contest certainly defied me and my
computer :)
