Combos is a [Games Magazine](Games Magazine "wikilink") puzzle where one
must find Disney animated films that have a series of letters in the
title. An example is "erpa = Peter Pan" because the letters e,r,p,a
appear in Peter Pan in that order. Sounds like a perfect job for Grep!

Code
----

Here is the code:

    #!/bin/bash
    for LETTER in `echo $1 | sed 's/./&\n/g'`
    do
    COMMAND="$COMMAND ?$LETTER"
    done
    exec egrep -e "$COMMAND" list

Explaination
------------

The code outputs an grep command like this: grep -e ' ?n ?d ?w' list The
class " ?" matches a possible blank space, then we have a "n", then any
number of characters, and so on. The above shell script just makes it
easy to create those reg-ex's.
