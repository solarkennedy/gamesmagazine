Each square stands for a letter of the alphabet, and corresponding
squares on different faces stand for the same letter. What three English
names of numbers do the three paths spell?

The start of each word is with the black dot, the end with a
perpendicular line.

Here are the numbers I get:

    10 1 8 7 10 13 16 7 8
    10 2 14 12 10 8 8 7
    8 14 9 2 10

Assign each number a letter and it becomes a cryptoquote:

    jahgjmqgh
    jbnljhhg
    hnibj

These are easy. If you want you can use this
[solver](http://home.hiwaay.net/~kdunn/problems/ciphform.shtml) with
this initial key:

    he aw my qo
    (this means h=e a=w m=y q=o). Even without this key it solves 2 out of 3.

The solution is:

    TWENTYONE
    THIRTEEN
    EIGHT
